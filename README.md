# Task-2
To visualize the sales data from the Excel sheet, I used several chart types to highlight different aspects of the dataset.
Stacked Bar Chart for Sum of Yearly Sales of Each Drug: This chart displays the total yearly sales for each drug, with each bar segmented by drug class. The visualization makes it easy to compare the overall contribution of each drug to annual sales. In this chart, N02BE consistently dominates the total yearly sales, followed by N05B and R03, while N05C makes the smallest contribution each year.

Line Chart for Yearly Trends: The line chart tracks the yearly sales trends for each drug class over time. This visualization reveals growth patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and any notable spikes or drops. N02BE shows a strong upward trend with periodic peaks, indicating robust and growing sales. N05B and R03 display moderate, steady trends, while classes like N05C remain flat and low, suggesting limited market performance.Stacked Area Chart for Relative Contribution of Each Drug

The stacked area chart illustrates the proportionate contribution of each drug class to total sales over time. This format highlights how the market share of each drug class shifts across years. N02BE occupies the largest area, reinforcing its leading role in the market, while the areas for N05C and R06 are much smaller, showing their relatively minor impact.

Clustered Bar Chart for Average Yearly Sales of Each Drug: This chart groups bars by year and drug class, allowing direct comparison of average yearly sales across all classes. N02BE again stands out with the highest average sales in every year, followed by N05B and R03. N05C consistently ranks lowest, with minimal variation across years.Across all visualizations, N02BE emerges as the top-performing drug class, with consistently high sales and a dominant market share. N05B and R03 are solid performers but do not approach the scale of N02BE. Other classes, particularly N05C, contribute far less, both in absolute sales and relative share, highlighting clear disparities in performance across the drug classes.
